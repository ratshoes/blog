        excerpt: 'Walked into a testing center on February 13th not sure if I was ready. Walked out with a Security+ certification. Here is the honest rundown.',
        content: `<p>So yeah I passed</p>

<p>On February 13th I walked into the Pearson VUE center, clicked through the NDA, and stared at the first question of the Security+ 701. I told myself I was ready but practice tests only go so far, and when it counted it was just me and the screen</p>

<p>I did not feel confident going in. I studied for about 20 days, maybe 60 hours total, including the nights where I almost fell asleep at my desk. I had taken the 601 version before and the 701 felt harder, and I had not tested in a long time which added more pressure than I expected</p>

<h2>How I Actually Studied</h2>

<p>There was no secret method. I used Professor Messer on YouTube and watched his full SY0-701 series about one and a half times, along with SkillCertPro practice exams</p>

<p>What made the biggest difference was writing by hand. I wrote out the CIA triad again and again, drew diagrams of how Kerberos works, and mapped authentication flows. My notebook looked messy by the end but it forced me to slow down and think, and that is what made it stick</p>

<p>Practice exams mattered too. Not because they matched the real test but because they exposed my weak spots, especially cryptography. I kept missing those questions so I drilled symmetric and asymmetric encryption until I could explain them clearly without guessing</p>

<h2>The Exam Itself</h2>

<p>The performance based questions showed up first with no warmup. You open the exam and you are staring at network diagrams and firewall rules, and it hits you fast. I flagged them, moved to multiple choice to build momentum, then came back with a clearer head</p>

<p>The multiple choice questions were heavy on scenarios. Not simple definitions but real situations, like a user who cannot access the VPN and logs showing failed authentication from an unusual IP, and you have to decide what to do first. You need to think through problems instead of just recalling terms</p>

<h2>What Got Me Through It</h2>

<p>Consistency. I studied every day for 20 days, sometimes 30 minutes, sometimes three or four hours, but I did not skip. Even when the material felt dry I showed up</p>

<p>I also explained topics out loud while driving or making dinner. If I stumbled while explaining something that told me I did not fully understand it, so I went back and reviewed until I could say it clearly</p>

<h2>So What Now</h2>

<p>CCNA is next. Security+ gave me a solid base in security concepts and network fundamentals, and now I want to go deeper into networking. I have not set a test date yet because I want more lab time first, but the momentum is there</p>

<p>If you are thinking about taking Security+ just start. Set a plan, stay consistent, and trust the process</p>`

        excerpt: 'Planning has never been my strong suit. This year I sat down and built a realistic certification roadmap for four exams in twelve months.',
        content: `<p>I have never really been the best at planning. Historically it has led to me making plans I could not follow up on, setting goals that sounded good on paper but fell apart the second life got in the way. But this year is about accountability and follow through</p>

<p>So I sat down and actually mapped this out. Four certifications in one year. Security+, CCNA, AWS Advanced Networking Specialty, and CCNP Enterprise. Written out like that it looks aggressive, and maybe it is, but I genuinely believe it is doable if I stay disciplined about it</p>

<h2>Why These Four</h2>

<p>It was not random. Security+ came first because it builds a foundation in security concepts that touches everything else. You cannot talk about networking or cloud without understanding the security side of it. CCNA follows naturally because it goes deep on the networking fundamentals that Security+ only scratches the surface of. Routing, switching, IP connectivity, all of that</p>

<p>AWS Advanced Networking after that because I want to take those networking skills and apply them in the cloud. Hybrid connectivity, VPCs, transit gateways, that sort of thing. And CCNP Enterprise at the end of the year to round it all out at a professional level. Each cert feeds into the next one. That was intentional</p>

<h2>Being Honest About the Timeline</h2>

<p>I gave myself roughly a quarter per certification. Security+ is already done so that frees up some breathing room. CCNA is the focus now and I want to take my time with it because networking is one of those things where if you rush it you end up with gaps that haunt you later</p>

<p>AWS in the summer makes sense because by then I should have a strong enough networking background to handle the specialty material. And CCNP in the fall gives me the most time for what will probably be the hardest one on the list</p>

<h2>What Makes This Year Different</h2>

<p>I think the biggest change is that I am treating this like a job. Not something I do when I feel motivated but something I show up for every single day. The Security+ process proved to me that consistency works better than cramming. Twenty days of steady effort beat the alternative of studying for two months with week long breaks in between</p>

<p>I also built in flexibility. If CCNA takes longer than expected I am not going to panic about it. The roadmap is a guide not a contract. The point is forward motion, not perfection</p>

<p>For the first time I actually feel like I have a plan I can stick to. That might not sound like much but for someone who has started and stopped more times than I can count, it means a lot</p>`

        excerpt: 'Taking the time to reset and gather the lessons learned over these past few months. Time does not wait for anyone.',
        content: `<p>Taking the time to reset along with gathering lessons learned among the last few months</p>

<p>There have been a few things I learned over the past few months. Besides being a lifelong learner, there are lessons that should only have to be learned once to capture their teachings and future impact. The driving forces behind my motivation to finally follow through on my plans have been significant and eye opening. These past four years have been a blur. I never felt the passage of time but now I realize that it is very real. Constant progress eluded me because I never took the formal steps to accomplish my goals</p>

<h2>Time Catches Up</h2>

<p>This year I set formal goals and I am proud to see that I am following through with them. I realized my parents are getting older. They are not the people I thought would never change because I was so used to them staying the same. My dad turned 72 years old a few days ago and that milestone just blew my mind</p>

<p>That realization moved something within me. I should call my parents more and make them proud</p>

<h2>Finding My Way Back</h2>

<p>My goals this year outlined by the creation of this blog are really just here for me to hold myself accountable and as a journal. I have really just begun to find myself after being lost for a few months. I did not know how I would recover but one day I woke up and decided I was going to make it work. I would pull myself out of the rut I was in and continue to push myself harder than I ever have</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough with this new job I currently have. It is my last chance to succeed realistically. Besides that, not saying no to new relationships both new and old, all the while growing individually, has made this easier for me</p>

<p>There will always be people who care about you. Forming new bonds, whether deep or shallow, will show you things about yourself you never knew. And some people who have always been there but now show up more than ever are a reminder that no matter where you are in life, someone always cares</p>`

        excerpt: 'Saying you will do something and failing to follow through compounds over time. Discipline has to be rooted in something more stable than impulse.',
        content: `<h2>On Discipline, Accountability, and the Road Ahead</h2>

<p>Simply saying is not enough</p>

<p>Action does not require motivation to produce a positive outcome. While motivation helps, discipline should not be driven by impulse. Impulsivity is unstable, and the emotion behind it fades. Discipline rooted in impulse can lead to burnout or, on the other end, inconsistency.</p>

<p>For a long time, I set things aside for later and failed to think more than a few steps ahead. While studying for these certifications, I've regained something I lost over time, and that is curiosity for learning, not just memorizing. Learning requires more than retaining information. It has to be applied in practice, not just understood on paper. I've also realized I don't need to tie deadlines to pressure and cram material down my throat. The process should be measured, consistent, and intentional at ALL times not just when stakes are high.</p>

<h2>The Pattern I Started to See</h2>

<p>Tying this back to my original thesis, simply saying something is not enough. Saying I will do something and then failing to follow through began to spill into other areas of my life, not just academics. I started to see the pattern more clearly. Sometimes it takes honest introspection and reflection on past experiences to understand what was really happening.</p>

<p>This is not a quick fix, but committing to this plan for the year will prove to myself that I can do what I set out to do.</p>

<h2>CCNA and What Comes After</h2>

<p>The next certification, the CCNA, is one I've had my eye on for years. Realistically, it may not move the needle as much as I once thought. I already have solid networking experience from my time in IT. Still, it carries weight. At the very least, it validates that I understand the theory behind the work I've been doing. The certification that truly changes trajectories for many people is the CCNP or Cisco Certified Network Professional. That one demands respect. It typically requires at least six months of intense study. It's not a checkbox credential. It is a commitment.</p>

<p>If I can compress six months of focused study into three through discipline and structure, I will earn it this year we shall see, we shall see.</p>`
